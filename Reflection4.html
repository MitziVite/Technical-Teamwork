    <b>What is the most significant take-a-way you have gained from your study this week? (10 points)</b><br><br>
    While reading the preparation material for this week, I learned that I am disciplined in some things and others I need to improve. 
    Also, I liked the recommendations in: "5 ways to improve self-discipline at work." Especially when it says: "focus your attention on 
    one self-discipline skill at a time" because I want to do a lot of things, and in the end, I don't do anything because I am trying to 
    be concentrated on a lot of tasks. <br><br>
    I liked what Elder Christofferson said:" Moral discipline is the consistent exercise of agency to choose the right because it is right,
    even when it is hard." It is essential to be motivated, but it is more important to be disciplined so that you can continue progressing
    in your goals when hard times come. <br><br>

    <b>Why is this week's topic important for teamwork? (20 points) </b><br><br>
    It is essential that teamwork can be disciplined and motivated. Because if they don't have discipline, they are going to do the work in the
     wrong way, there are going to be more problems between the team; they can become lazy, there is not going to be enough support, and so more.
    Those are some reasons that make it essential to have discipline and motivating teamwork. <br>
    Sometimes, when things are getting more complex, or there are trials, it is vital to show that you are self-motivated because that helps the 
    team feel supported and motivated. But, it also is crucial when we need the motivation to hear and be surrounded by those who are good influences 
    for us. Even when it is hard, it is essential to be an excellent example for those around us. <br><br>

    <b>How does your experience relate to other classmates' experiences? (20 points)</b><br><br>
    While we were in the classroom, some of my classmates said they had depression or anxiety. At a time in my life, I had depression, so I understand 
    that in those moments is difficult to be motivated or be disciplined. Even though I heard their stories, I recognized that something that helps me 
    be more self-motivated is to have a specific goal in my mind. Reward me when I did a difficult task or I tried my best. Ask God for help. Talk with 
    my family and friends to express my feelings and serve others. <br><br>

    <b> If you were to write your experience as STAR story, how would you phrase it? (20 points)</b><br><br>
    When I was younger, I used to work in a boutique. My schedule was from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m. It was very hard, but I enjoyed it. Something that was happening 
    in this boutique was that almost all my co-workers didn't treat the people very well because they were exhausted. So, I started to smile more, talk more 
    to them, show more motivation, and give compliments. As time passed, my co-workers became more friendly to each other, and the environment changed. We started
    to have more clients, they returned more frequently, and the sales improved. It was hard for me because I was exhausted, but being disciplined helped me continue 
    showing a good example and helping my co-workers enjoy their job more. <br><br>

    <b>If this was a religion class, how would you relate this week's topic to the gospel?</b><br><br>
    I like that the gospel teaches us that faith is action and helps us understand that we need to be proactive. That made me believe that we have to be disciplined to
    do what is right. One of my favorite scriptures is DyC 88:124: "Cease to be idle; cease to be unclean; cease to find fault one with another; cease to sleep longer than 
    is needful; retire to thy bed early, that ye may not be weary; arise early, that your bodies and your minds may be invigorated." <br> Because it helps me remember why I am doing
    what I do. Even when it is challenging to continue, we can do it with the help of the Lord.
