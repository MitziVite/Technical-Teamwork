    <h1>Mitzi Itzel Vite Hernandez</h1>
<h3>My style:</h3>
I am green, which means I adapt very fast to new situations. I tend to make logical decisions rather than sentimental ones. I love learning new things, and even though I am not very sociable, I am a good communicator and listener. I can learn a lot of things quickly because of the passion that I have when something is interesting for me. <br>
When I need to decide what I do depends on the impact of the decision if it Is very important for my life, I try to analyze it, pray about it and after I see the possibilities, I make the decision. If it is not very important, I just think about what is the best thing to do. <br>

<h3> What I value:</h3>
Family : I love my family, and I feel happy when I am with them. They are a big pillar in my life. And I believe that good families can create good citizens. <br>
Diligence: It is challenging to start new things, but it is harder to continue doing them. I think that diligence is something that I appreciate the most in people. <br>
Knowledge: To have excellent knowledge of one subject means that a person has spent some time learning it and can retain that information. I think that is something difficult. That's the reason that I value it a lot. <br>

<h3> What I don't have patience for: </h3>
Egocentrism : When people just take care of themselves and don't help others, even when they see that they can satisfy and refuse to help. <br>
Pretentious : When people think that they are better than others for having more things or skills. That makes people around them feel uncomfortable. <br>
Lies : I don't like when people have a double face: they say one in front of you and something different behind your back. Or they lie to avoid confrontation. 


<h3> How best to communicate with me: </h3>
I like when people are polite and kind. Also, when I make mistakes, they can tell me privately instead of in front of a group. And,  I like when people tell me the good things that I do. <br>
I prefer that they communicate in person. That they can be straightforward if they have suggestions for me to improve.

<h3> How to help me: </h3>
Listening : When someone listens to the problems that I have, it is easier for me to solve them while I am talking. And I am very grateful when they give me suggestions to solve the problems. <br>
Be clear : I appreciate when people are honest and help me see areas where I can improve.
<h3> What people misunderstand about me:</h3>
One of the things that people misunderstand about me is that they think that I am very reserved and that I am not humble. But when they start to know me, they change their mind.
