        <h1>Reflection       Name: Mitzi I. Vite                     Total Points: 100 points </h1>

        <b> What did I do to prepare for class this week? (5 points) </b> <br> <br>
        I read the "7 ways to build influence in the workplace", "Everyone has influence," and "MIM." While I was reading this material, I underlined it. <br><br>

        <b> What concept from this week are you uncertain of or would like to know more about? (5 points) </b><br><br>
        I want to learn more about the" Multidimensional Influence Model," specifically about connectedness and representation. <br><br>

        <b> What topics were studied this week, and what are their definitions? (5 points)</b> <br><br>
        We learned about influence. One model that shows us how we influence others is MIM, divided into actions and beliefs. 
        And we reviewed the importance of teamwork and learned that all people have influence. <br><br>

        <b> Summarize this week's scenario? (5 points)</b><br><br>
        We did an assessment that helps us know how well prepared we are to influence the people around us, and we could learn about some competencies we need to improve. <br><br>

        <b> What did I learn from the study material? (5 points)</b> <br><br>
        I realized that I influence others even without noticing it. That influence is something we gain little by little. That's why we need to take our time to build relationships. 
        I learned that I need to have empathy for others, be flexible, listen to others, and give importance to their words so they can feel valued.  <br><br>

        <b> How did this week's scenario relate to the week's topic? (5 points) </b><br><br>
        It is related because it helped me see opportunities I have to influence others. And I learned competencies that I can improve. <br><br>

        <b> What is the most significant take-a-way you have gained from your study this week? (10 points) </b> <br><br>
        This week, the most important thing for me was that I could influence others more than with my words by my actions. I can influence others and improve my skills to be a better influencer. Listening to others and allowing them to express their thoughts shows that I respect them and trust them. <br><br>

        <b> What would you do differently next week? (10 points) </b><br><br>
        If there is a problem with the preparation material, I would tell him with more time. I also would like to work on reliability by being constant and doing what I said I would do. <br><br>

        <b> How does the weekly topic relate to the MIM model? (10 points) </b><br><br>

        They were very related because we learned about what it is, and we did an assessment that helped us see areas where we can work to influence better and more others. <br><br>

        <b> Why is this week's topic important for teamwork? (20 points) </b> <br><br>

        It is essential because when we work with others, we will influence them. And in this week's issue, we learned how we do it, which allows us to be more aware of our actions, decisions, and words. That helps us find ways to improve our communication and our influence on others. <br><br>
        <b> If this was a religion class, how would you relate this week's topic to the gospel? (20 points) </b> <br><br>
        To help others come to the Lord, we need to have faith. Faith is belief and acts according to our beliefs. Everything begins in our thoughts and the way we perceive the things around us. We have the MIM model, which gives an idea of how we influence others and ourselves. 
        When we love our brethren and try to have more Christlike attributes, we can naturally influence others. We can be better friends, better co-workers, and better people. Because they will see that we love them, we will be aware of their trials, and we will have the desire to help them.
