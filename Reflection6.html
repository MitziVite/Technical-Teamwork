   <h1> Reflection #6      Name: Mitzi I. Vite Hernandez                     Total Points: 100 points </h1>

   <b> What did I do to prepare for class this week? (5 points) </b><br>
   I read the preparation material, and I tried to share some parts of the things that I learned from it with my roommates. <br><br>
   
   <b> What topics were studied this week, and what are their definitions? (5 points) </b><br>
   This week, we talked more about our user's manual and pressure. We made some definitions of work, love, health, and play. We made some plans for our near future and more. All of those are necessities that we need to cover in our lifetime, and we need to understand them to make priorities in our lives. <br><br>
   
   <b> What is the most significant take-a-way you have gained from your study this week? (10 minutes) </b><br>
   I found this quote in the preparation material: "Unplugging can mean something simple like practicing transit meditation on your daily commute, instead of checking work emails." When I was reading that, I set the goal of starting my day with 5 minutes of meditation and doing exercise, and I saw a difference during this week in my productivity at work and school. I felt happier and more motivated. So I want o to continue practicing this. <br><br>
   
   <b> Why is this week's topic important for teamwork? (20 points)</b> <br>
   Pressure is something that we are going to have a lot of times when we work. It is essential to learn how to deal with it. So, it doesn't affect an opposing way team and us. In moments of pressure, we need to have a plan, prioritize, and remember that we can't control everything. We need to remember why we do what we do to continue forward. <br><br>
   
   <b> How does your experience relate to other experiences you have had? (20 points) </b><br>
   While I was in high school, I had a tough time. I felt a lot of pressure, and I didn't have priorities. That led me to start having depression and didn't take care of my health. Because of that, I needed to learn how to act under pressure. I learned that the first thing that I need to take care of is my health and find meaning in what I am doing. And don't forget to take care of my other roles in life, like being a friend, a sister, and a daughter. And try to find joy on the way. <br><br>
   
   <b> Tell me about what you taught someone? And what did they learn that they didn't know before? (20 points) </b><br>
   This week I was speaking with one friend about our goals and concerns about the future, and he told me that he knows what to study, but he is not sure. He told me that he is having a hard time because of all the changes. So, I told him that he doesn't need to worry about the pressure that he is feeling from his family, time, or the things that make him sad. I taught him that the Lord would help him with the decisions that he is making, but he needs to trust him and act and to don't paralyze because of the pressure. Also, he should not waste time and energy worrying about things that he can't control and concentrate on the ones that he can. He said that was very helpful, and he is going to try to make priorities and find ways to take more care of his health. <br><br>
   
   <b> How would you relate this week's topic to the gospel if this was a religion class? (20 points) </b><br>
   In our lives, there will be a lot of times that we will confront pressure. Even though those times are problematic, if we put God first, he will help us overcome them. He is going to enable us to feel peace and be successful. I like this quote that explains how the Lord help us in those times: <br>
   "Patience is the capacity to endure delay, trouble, opposition, or suffering without becoming angry, frustrated, or anxious. It is the ability to do God's will and accept His timing. When you are patient, you hold up under pressure and can face adversity calmly and hopefully." <br>
