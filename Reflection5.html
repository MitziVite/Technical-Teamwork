   <h1> Reflection Name: Mitzi Itzel Vite Hernandez  Total Points: 100 points</h1>

<h3> What did I do to prepare for class this week? (5 points) </h3>
I read the articles listed on I-lean about professionalism and highlighted the things that could help me the most.

<h3>What did I learn from the study material? (5 points)</h3>
I learned that it is good to don't know everything and ask for help. To accept that you need help is a demonstration of humility. When people see that, it is easier for them to trust you.

<h3>What would you do differently next week? (10 points)</h3>
This week I want to show more confidence when I explain something that I know is true, so my team can trust me more. And I am going to listen more carefully to them so I can give better suggestions.

<h3>Why is this week's topic important for teamwork? (20 points)</h3>
Professionalism is essential for teamwork because it creates a better environment for everyone. If we, do it, we can trust each other and be more productive. When we act with professionalism, people will depend more on us because they will know that we treat others with respect. Also, we take care of the company, arrive on time, keep our word, and don't gossip. 

<h3>Tell me about what you taught someone? And what did they learn that they didn't know before? (20 points)</h3>
I talked with my roommate about what professionalism means to me and something that I taught her about being punctual, and I shared some things that help me be punctual. She learned that to be punctual when you are someone who procrastinates a lot is to understand why you need to arrive on time, and when you know it, you will feel more motivated to do it. 

<h3>If you were to write your experience as STAR story, how would you phrase it? (20 points)</h3>
During the mission, I trained some sisters. My responsibility was to help them understand the duties and activities as missionaries. Something that helped me a lot was to try to be an excellent example for them. To show motivation, take care of them, and be humble to accept that I didn't know everything and receive feedback from them. That helped me gain their trust and work better together and be successful in our assigned areas. 

<h3>How would you relate this week's topic to the gospel if this was a religion class? (20 points)</h3>
In many cases, someone who tries to be professional is someone who tries to follow Jesus Christ. If you are someone with professionalism, you will be respectful, punctual, consistent, and keep your word. Jesus Christ was the whole person in the world, and if we try to follow his example, we will have this gift little by little.
