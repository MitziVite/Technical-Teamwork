    <h1>Reflection #3      Name: Mitzi I. Vite                     Total Points: 100 points </h1><br>

    <b>What did I do to prepare for class this week? (5 points)</b><br>

    I read the material before the first class and took the time to analyze it and highlight the parts that I considered important. <br><br>

    <b>What concept from this week are you uncertain of or would like to know more about? (5 points)</b><br>

    I would like to know more about ambiverts and ways that an introvert or an extrovert can develop complex abilities for them. Also, what kind of personalities are more requested
    by industries. <br><br>

    <b>What topics were studied this week, and what are their definitions? (5 points)</b><br>

    We studied self-awareness, personality, introverts, extroverts, and ambivert. We learned that one of the most recognized abilities is self-awareness and if someone has this ability is easier to trust. Also, personality is different for each person, and tests don't help you know your character completely, but they can help you understand yourself 
    better and know areas where you can improve.<br><br>

    <b>Summarize this week's scenario? (5 points)</b> <br>

    In this week's scenario, we played fox and gees. These characters move diagonally, and the first one that arrives at the opposite border wins. While we played this game, we needed to use logic and strategy. We learned through this game that to be a more productive team, we need to develop self-awareness and take care of the ones in our
    group. <br><br>

    <b>What did I learn from the study material? (5 points)</b><br>

    In the TED talk, I learned that even though I consider myself an introvert, I have some abilities that extroverts have. So, anybody is entirely an introvert or an extrovert. If that were the case, that person could be crazy. Also, that is necessary to help introverts or extroverts learn in their field. That doesn't mean that we are not going to do tasks that are considered just for extroverts or introverts; it means that we are going to help them improve them so they can have more abilities and do what they are good at.<br><br>

    <b>Why is this week's topic important? (5 points)</b><br>

    It is essential to understand your personality because if you know yourself, it will be easier to know the areas where you can improve and the areas where you are strong. You can help better your teamwork and others because you will be more self-aware and better understand the world around us.<br> <br>

    <b>How did this week's scenario relate to the week's topic? (5 points)</b><br>

    It is related because we learned about self-awareness, and with this scenario, we learned that it is essential to use strategy and logic to win the game. Also that the geese needed to work as a team, so the fox didn't destroy the line. This example exemplifies the meaning of don't let one of our coworkers go behind, that we need to work together and strengthen those who are having trouble. <br><br>

    <b>What is the most significant take-a-way you have gained from your study this week? (10 points)</b><br>

    The most important thing that I learned this week was that I need to continue getting to know more about myself and work more on my goals. That is not to be selfish; it is taking care of myself to work better with a team. <br><br>

    <b> Why is this week's topic important for teamwork? (20 points)</b><br>

    This week's scenario is vital to teamwork because if we want to help others, we need to work first with ourselves; if we are fine, we will be a better influence on others, and we can bring our strengths to our team. Also, knowing our weaknesses is very important because we can receive the help we need. <br><br>

    <b>How do you plan on contributing to the team besides completing your tasks? (20 
    points)</b><br>

    We talked after class, and we exchanged our numbers, so if someone needed help with the homework or something that we didn't understand, we could help each other. That is one of the best ways to know each other and develop more confidence in our team. <br><br>

    <b>How would you relate this week's topic to the gospel if this was a religion class? 
     (20 points)</b><br>

    I would relate it with the second great commandment: "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." Because to know ourselves better, to be more self-aware, and take care of ourselves is part of fulfilling this commandment. If we take time to work on ourselves, we will be able to help others in a better way because we can't give something that we don't have.
