<h1> Reflection #7</h1>
<h3>Name: Mitzi Itzel Vite Hernandez                     Total Points: 100 points</h3>
<p><b> What did I do to prepare for class this week? (5 points) </b></p> 
I analyzed the preparation material before our first class and highlight the parts that I considered important. <br><br>
<p><b>What actions were assigned to you, in your team meeting? (5 points)</b></p>
I am assigned to track the progress of our goals in my team. Also, I will be working on our first acorn project, so I can be able to finish it the next week. <br><br>
<p><b> What is the most significant take-a-way you have gained from your study this week? (10 points)</b></p><br>
The most important thing that I learned from this week's preparation material was when we are not able to do something we need to be honest and tell our manager if it is possible or not, and don’t try to be the “hero” because that could lead to losing the trust of our coworkers. Also, when we are not capable of doing something, we need to search for help and don’t keep it to ourselves, because that could lead to future problems, and in if we do so we can gain more trust and have the help that we need. <br><br>
<p><b> Why is this week's topic important for teamwork? (20 points) </b></p>
It is essential to understand what commitment means to help our team feel more capable of reaching the goals that we establish. Moreover, when we have a team that understands the value of fulfilling our words, we can be in an environment where we can trust each other and avoid certain kinds of conflicts. We can be more productive and efficient and work at a better pace. <br><br>
<p><b> How do plan on contributing to the team, besides completing your tasks? (20 points)</b></p>
Something that I did this week for my team was helping each of us to gather to complete this week’s homework. Also, I am in charge of helping them remember their goals. And track their progress in each project. As well, I am planning to help the environment of our team to be more friendly, by bringing snacks. <br>
<p><b> How does your experience relate to other experiences you have had? (20 points)</b></p>
During the mission, my companion and I, have daily goals and weekly goals. We also had goals with the ward where we were serving, and it was sometimes difficult to reach all our goals, The most difficult part for me was when we told the ward that we didn’t achieve them. But something that I learned during that time was that we need to be clear with others to understand their roles and responsibilities in a kind way. Also, we need to measure our goals and have real goals that we know that we can do. <br><br>
<p><b> If this was a religion class, how would you relate this week’s topic to the gospel? (20 points)</b></p>
While I was studying this week's material, I remembered the scripture in James 5:12 “But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea be yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation.” This scripture explains that the things that we say, we need to do them. And this week, we learned that we need to learn how to help our managers to understand our position and what can we do or not. <br><br>
